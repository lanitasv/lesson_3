		<h1>Ukraine war: We've retaken 6,000 sq km from Russia, says Zelensky</h1>
		<h2>Ukrainian forces have seized even more territory from Russia as they continue their counter-offensive, the
			country's president has said.</h2>
		<div class="first-part">
			<div class="text">
				<p>Volodymyr Zelensky said troops have now retaken more than 6,000 sq km <br>(2,317 sq miles) from Russian
					control
					in September, in the east and the south.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="text first-part">
				<p>The BBC cannot verify these figures.</p>
				<p>Russia has admitted losing key cities in the north-eastern Kharkiv region, in <br> what is seen by some
					military
					experts as a potential breakthrough in the war.</p>
				<p>Moscow describes its troop withdrawal from the region in recent days as a <br> "regrouping" with the aim
					of
					focusing on the Luhansk and Donetsk regions in <br> Ukraine's east.</p>
				<p>That claim has been ridiculed even in Russia, with many social media users <br> there describing the
					stated
					pull-out as "shameful".</p>
			</div>
			<p id="block">Speaking later on Monday, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said <br> Ukrainian forces had
				made
				"significant progress" in their counter-offensive, <br> but added that it was too early to predict the
				outcome</p>
			<p>"The Russians maintain very significant forces in Ukraine as well as equipment <br> and arms and munitions.
				They
				continue to use it indiscriminately against not <br> just the Ukrainian armed forces but civilians and
				civilian infrastructure as <br> we've seen," Mr Blinken said.</p>
			<p>Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered a full-scale invasion of Ukraine on 24 <br> February. Russia still
				holds
				about a fifth of the country.</p>

			<p>In his late video address on Monday, President Zelensky said: "From the <br> beginning of September until
				today,
				our warriors have already liberated more <br> than 6,000 sq km of the territory of Ukraine - in the east and
				south".</p>
			<p>"The movement of our troops continues," he said.</p>
			<p>The counter-offensive appears to have been rapid. Last Thursday, President <br> Zelensky said Ukrainian
				forces
				had retaken 1,000 sq km, but by Sunday that <br> stated figure <mark> <a
						href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62867560" target="_blank">had tripled to 3,000 sq
						km.</a></mark>
			</p>
			<p>Mr Zelensky thanked several of Ukraine's brigades involved in the counter- <br> offensive, describing their
				fighters as "true heroes".</p>
			<p>He did not reveal which Ukrainian cities and villages had been liberated</p>

			<p>Ukrainian troops pose with flags in a village retaken from Russian control in the north-eastern Kharkiv
				region</p>
			<p>Russia's military earlier admitted that its troops had to leave the key cities of <br> Balakliya, Izyum and
				Kupiansk in the Kharkiv region. Russia now controls only <br> a small eastern part of the region.</p>
			<p>Significant - albeit slower - advances by Ukrainian troops have also been <br> reported in the southern
				Kherson region, which borders with Crimea - a <br> Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014.</p>
			<p>UK defence officials say the Ukrainian army's recent successes will have <br> "significant implications" for
				Russia's overall operational design.</p>
			<p>However, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has insisted that military <br> operations in Ukraine will continue
				"until all the tasks that were initially set" <br> have been fulfilled.</p>
			<p>Russia says its forces have been carrying out strikes in those areas retaken by <br> Ukraine in recent days.
			</p>

		<div class="second-part">
			<p>Valerii Marchenko, mayor of Izyum, told the BBC the Ukrainian army was in his <br> city and the state flag
				had
				been raised.</p>
			<p>The military is now engaged in cleaning up the war-torn city and Ukrainian <br> forces are searching for
				Russian soldiers potentially hiding in people's houses.</p>
			<p>Mr Marchenko said that after "about 10 days", residents who had to flee the <br> city would be able to
				return
				"safely".</p>
			<p>Russia has been accused of targeting civilian infrastructure in revenge for <br> setbacks on the
				battlefield.</p>
			<p>A wave of missile strikes on Sunday caused massive power cuts across north- <br> eastern Ukraine, leaving
				tens of
				thousands of people without electricity and <br> running water for several hours.</p>

			<h2><b>Ukraine answers crucial questions</b></h2>
			<p>The Ukrainians believe they've answered important questions. Can they break <br> the stalemate and recapture
				territory? Yes. Can they use Western weapons <br> effectively? Yes. The result is their most important
				victory since winning the <br> battle for Kyiv back in March</p>
			<p>This matters because without proof they can win, they fear that the economic <br> costs of supporting
				Ukraine and opposing Russia might be too much for some <br> of their NATO allies, especially over a long,
				hard winter.</p>
			<p>As for the Russians, this was a rout. Not a fighting retreat or a redeployment.<br> Military intelligence
				failed and soldiers with catastrophically poor morale <br> abandoned large amounts of equipmen</p>
			<p>The Ukrainians know what they're fighting for - it is not clear that the Russians <br> do.</p>
